# Purpose 
The purpose of this assignment is to use openweather API to create a weather forecast overview app that saves and displays city inputs to the page.

# My Experience
I enjoyed creating this app since it helped me understand the open weatherapi documentation, and I really liked playing around with the response that was returned from the api.
